# rml

Find bugs in code.

At a high-level, using `rml` looks like:
1. Change a file.
2. Run `rml changed/file.py`.
3. Fix bugs identified by `rml`, repeat.



# Getting Started

## Installation

If you just want to use `rml` you can install by running: 

```bash
curl install.recurse.ml | sh
```

## Usage

_To run `rml` you need to be in a git repo_

Modify a local file and run:

```bash
rml funky/src/file.js
```

By default `rml` analyzes unstaged changes (i.e. the ones displayed by `git diff` without any arguments).

You can also specify the changes to compare against, by specifying `--base` and/or `--head` explicitly (they accept arbitrary git refs):

```bash
rml funky/src/file.js --base HEAD^

# or between branches
rml funky/src/file.js --base HEAD --head feat/chameleon
```
